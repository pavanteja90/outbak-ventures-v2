# OutbakVenturesV2

This is the second iteration of the Outbak Ventures website which is developed on angular platform. Initial iteration of the website was developed on wordpress and that implementation has a lot of dead links and bugs. To improve the user experience and also to increase the integrity of the company, we navigated from wordpress and developed the website from scratch on angular. This iteration, version 2.0.0 as we call it has been revamped on the content as well as the design pattern of the website. Follow the below instructions to build this website on your own.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
